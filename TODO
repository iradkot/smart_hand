Tasks
1. We should force the user to also add all test utils files.
2. Add the relevant types for the file we wish to create the tests for


My goal currently is to achieve a circle of development with gpt, meaning :
1. I provide gpt with test types, app types (maybe names ony), test utils, and the file I wish to test.
2. Gpt will return a response of whether he has all the necessary files to create the tests.
  a. If he does, he will create the tests and return them to me. and with a response of ready: true
  b. If he doesn't, he will return a response of `ready: false`, and what he need next:
    1. If current test utils are not enough, he will ask for adding new test utils to which files and where, an
      1.a. if he has all that is required for creating the testUtils, he will return a response of the following format:
        {
          action: 'create file'/ 'add to file'/'replace file'/'replace in file', // this is a general action which can be perform to anything
          type: 'testUtils', // this is the type of file we are going to create
          file: 'path/to/file', // this is the path to the file we are going to create
          content: 'content of the file' // this is the content of the file we are going to create
          line?: 1, // this is the line number where we are going to add the content, not sure if we need it
        }
      1.b. if he doesn't have all that is required for creating the testUtils, he will return a response of the following format:
        {
          action: 'get file'(if he knows path to file he needs) / 'ask for file'(if he doesn't know the path to file he needs, this should open a prompt for the user to provide the path to the file),
          type: 'testUtils',
          file: 'path/to/file',
          content: 'content of the file'
          line?: 1,
        }
